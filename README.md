# belly-button-challenge

## Background
- In this assignment, you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset Links to an external site., which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## Instructions
1. Use the D3 library to read in samples.json from the URL.
1. Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.
1. Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.
1. Display the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.
1. Display each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page.
1. Update all the plots when a new sample is selected.
1. Deploy your app to a free static page hosting service, such as GitHub Pages.
